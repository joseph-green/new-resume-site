People have different ways of showing love. Some like to write sappy poetry or compose heartfelt ballads. However, for the more romantically doomed like myself, who can neither poeticize nor sing, I must rely on a more unspright medium: code.

So, how does one affectionately write software for their partner? As much as compilers or Javascript frameworks are labours of love, as a romantic gift they aren't appreciated. Therefore, when all other options are exhausted, there's only one to do: I'll make a game.

For this game, I wanted to make something Wordle-esque. We've been playing it religiously for months, so adding another game to share would be fun. Also, I like the dynamic of one daily solution shared across all users that updates at midnight and whose results can be easily shared (but not spoiled) via text. That being said, I didn't want it to be too derivative, as plenty of spin-offs (like the ever-chaotic 2^n cousins [Quordle](https://www.quordle.com/#/), [Octordle](https://octordle.com/), and [Sedecorcle](https://www.sedecordle.com/)) already exist. I don't believe in adding another entity to the Wordle Cinematic Universe.

Alas, I found inspiration from another source: DNA Sequence Alignment. Lining up fragments of characters to determine a solution (i.e. a genome) is already a challenge that genomic scientists (and their computers) undertake, but the solutions don't mean anything to laypeople. So, what if we did the same task, but the solutions were actual words and phrases? That's fun.

Etaki (whose name an anagram of my girlfriend, Katie), is a daily word game where users try to uncover the hidden message by placing tiles on a board. Tiles can overlap, and clues can span muliple words. The faster you get the solution, the better the score. You can play the game [here](https://etaki.joseph.green)
